### Thread.join()/Thread.join(millis)/Thread.join(mills, nanos)
Sychronized方法，@Guardedby(this),在本线程对象上等待，直到线程死亡的时候调用this.notifyall(). 支持限时等待，超过时间就不等待了，也就是放弃join的动作。
适用场景：主线程需要等待多个子线程执行完毕才能进行合并结果

```
/**
     * Waits at most {@code millis} milliseconds for this thread to
     * die. A timeout of {@code 0} means to wait forever.
     *
     * <p> This implementation uses a loop of {@code this.wait} calls
     * conditioned on {@code this.isAlive}. As a thread terminates the
     * {@code this.notifyAll} method is invoked. It is recommended that
     * applications not use {@code wait}, {@code notify}, or
     * {@code notifyAll} on {@code Thread} instances.
     *
     * @param  millis
     *         the time to wait in milliseconds
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the value of {@code millis} is negative
     *
     * @throws  InterruptedException
     *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
     *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
     *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
     */
    public final synchronized void join(long millis)
    throws InterruptedException {
        long base = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long now = 0;

        if (millis < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
        }

        if (millis == 0) {
            while (isAlive()) {
                wait(0);
            }
        } else {
            while (isAlive()) {
                long delay = millis - now;
                if (delay <= 0) {
                    break;
                }
                wait(delay);
                now = System.currentTimeMillis() - base;
            }
        }
    }
```

### Thread.sleep(millis)/Thread.sleep(mills, nanos)
native方法，释放CPU资源，但不会释放持有的锁。时间到了之后，该线程会被唤醒，重新参与CPU竞争

```
/**
     * Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
     * execution) for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to
     * the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread
     * does not lose ownership of any monitors.
     *
     * @param  millis
     *         the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the value of {@code millis} is negative
     *
     * @throws  InterruptedException
     *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
     *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
     *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
     */
    public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException;
```

### Object.wait()/Object.wait(millis)/Object.wait(mills, nanos)
native方法，使用前提必须持有锁。释放持有的锁，释放CPU资源。
使用模式：
synchronized (obj) {
  while (condition does not hold) {
    obj.wait(millis);
  }
}

```
/**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or a
     * specified amount of time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor.
     * <p>
     * This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
     * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
     * any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
     * becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
     * until one of four things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
     * object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
     * the thread to be awakened.
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
     * object.
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
     * thread <var>T</var>.
     * <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
     * {@code timeout} is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
     * consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
     * </ul>
     * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
     * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
     * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
     * object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
     * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
     * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
     * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
     * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
     * was invoked.
     * <p>
     * A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
     * timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
     * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
     * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
     * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
     * waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
     *             obj.wait(timeout);
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
     * "Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
     * 2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
     * Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).
     *
     * <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
     * interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an
     * {@code InterruptedException} is thrown.  This exception is not
     * thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
     * described above.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code wait} method, as it places the current thread
     * into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
     * other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain
     * locked while the thread waits.
     * <p>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     *
     * @param      timeout   the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
     * @exception  IllegalArgumentException      if the value of timeout is
     *               negative.
     * @exception  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of the object's monitor.
     * @exception  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
     *             current thread before or while the current thread
     *             was waiting for a notification.  The <i>interrupted
     *             status</i> of the current thread is cleared when
     *             this exception is thrown.
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notify()
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notifyAll()
     */
    public final native void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException;
```

### Object.notify()/Object.notifyAll()
native方法。前提是已经拥有该对象的锁。notify()唤醒一个正在等待这个对象锁的线程，在线程等待池中随机唤醒一个。唤醒的线程先参与CPU竞争，然后参与该对象锁竞争。
notifyAll() 的差别是唤醒该对象锁的线程等待池中的所有线程。

```
/**
     * Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's
     * monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them
     * is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at
     * the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's
     * monitor by calling one of the {@code wait} methods.
     * <p>
     * The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current
     * thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will
     * compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be
     * actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the
     * awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being
     * the next thread to lock this object.
     * <p>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the
     * object's monitor in one of three ways:
     * <ul>
     * <li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.
     * <li>By executing the body of a {@code synchronized} statement
     *     that synchronizes on the object.
     * <li>For objects of type {@code Class,} by executing a
     *     synchronized static method of that class.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.
     *
     * @exception  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notifyAll()
     * @see        java.lang.Object#wait()
     */

    /**
     * Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A
     * thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the

### 线程状态

new: 线程还没开始
runnable: 线程已经开始在JVM中执行，当可能在等系统CUP或其他资源。调用了start()之后的状态。
blocked：等待内置锁。
waiting：等待被notify
timed_waiting: 限时等待被notify
terminated: run完

         * state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may
         * be waiting for other resources from the operating system
         * such as processor.

### 调度优先级：
JVM提供了1-10个优先级，但实际应用中，各种OS平台的优先级不同，需要做一个映射，并不准确。在实际应用中，通常不会设置一些细节的数字，而是设置为普通，最大，最小。

```
    /**
     * The minimum priority that a thread can have.
     */
    public final static int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;

   /**
     * The default priority that is assigned to a thread.
     */
    public final static int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;

    /**
     * The maximum priority that a thread can have.
     */
    public final static int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
```

### 线程栈的获取
Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()
Exception().getStackTrack()

```
public class ThreadStackTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printStack(getStackByThread());
        printStack(getStackByException());
    }

    private static void printStack(StackTraceElement[] stacks) {
        for (StackTraceElement stack : stacks) {
            System.out.println(stack);
        }
        System.out.println("\n");
    }

    private static StackTraceElement[] getStackByThread() {
        return Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
    }

    private static StackTraceElement[] getStackByException() {
        return new Exception().getStackTrace();
    }
}
```
